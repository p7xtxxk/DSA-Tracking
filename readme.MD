## 📁 DSA Practice in Java

---

This repository serves as a personal log and version control system for tracking progress through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics and practice problems, implemented entirely in **Java**.

### 🌟 Goal

The primary objective of this repository is to systematically cover foundational DSA concepts, solidify understanding through implementation, and maintain a clean, commit-by-commit history of problem-solving efforts.

### 📚 Structure

The content is organized by topic or concept, with all code files placed under the relevant directory.

| Folder/Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src/` (or root) | Contains all Java source files (`.java`). |
| `DayX_TopicName.java` | Standardized file naming convention. |
| `.gitignore` | Ensures compiled files (like `.class` files) are never committed. |

### 🛠️ Key Topics Covered

This section will be updated as new topics are completed.

### 🚀 Usage and Development Workflow

All contributions (which are personal practice files) follow a simple, atomic commit workflow:

1.  **Work on a new file or topic:** Complete the code for a specific DSA problem/topic.
2.  **Stage all changes:** `git add .`
3.  **Commit the work:** `git commit -m "Day [X]: Completed [Topic] - [Problem Name/Focus]"`
4.  **Push the commit:** `git push origin main` (or `master`)
